            <h2>Favorite Scene</h2>
            <p>My favourite scene is from a japanese anime/manga called Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin. "It's all meaningless. No matter what dreams or hopes you had... No matter how blessed a life you've lived... It's all the same if you're shredded by rocks. Everyone will die someday. Does that mean that life is meaningless? Was there even any meaning in our being born? Would you say that of our fallen comrades? Their lives, were they meaningless? No, they weren't! It's us who gives meaning to our comrades' lives! The brave fallen! The anguished fallen! The ones who will remember them are us the living. We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world! My soldiers, rage! My soldiers, scream! My soldiers, fight!" In this emotional and inspiring speech, Erwin stands before the remnants of the Survey Corps, who are facing the seemingly insurmountable task of retaking Wall Maria from the Titans. He acknowledges the overwhelming odds stacked against them and reflects on the sacrifices made by countless soldiers who have died in the fight against the Titans. Erwin expresses his own selfish desire to reach the truth hidden in Eren Yeager's basement, a truth that could potentially change everything for humanity. He admits that he's been driven by this desire, and it has cost the lives of many brave soldiers. However, he also acknowledges that this mission could be their last, and that their chances of survival are slim. He asks the soldiers to make a choice: to either join him in the charge towards the Beast Titan, which represents their best chance of victory, or to turn back and save themselves. He emphasizes the importance of giving meaning to the lives lost by dedicating themselves to this mission. Erwin's speech resonates with the soldiers, and many choose to follow him into battle. This pivotal moment showcases Erwin's leadership and his ability to inspire his troops in the face of despair. Erwin's speech is a powerful moment in the series, highlighting themes of sacrifice, leadership, and the relentless pursuit of the truth in a world filled with uncertainty and danger.</p>
